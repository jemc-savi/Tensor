# Tensor

This repository is intended to hold [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) bindings for Savi.

## Status

Currently this repository is being used as a proof of concept, and as an avenue for comparison with wrapping `tensorflow` vs wrapping `pytorch` - each of them having their own strengths and weaknesses.
